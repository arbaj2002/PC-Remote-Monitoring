*Problem statement*

1. Nowadays we are seeing generally in colleges Students learn the Concepts and apply those in actual practical implementations. The same procedure is followed by every colleges in this field of Education and Technology.

2. We are living in the world where everyone uses Computer .It has become one of the essential thing without which our work is unsuccessful.  If we look into the Technical colleges students learn and perform practical. But, the case is, only one teacher is generally assigned to the practical class where students ranges between 30-100 which anyone can say it is impossible to see everyone’s performance.

3. That’s where our Application comes into the picture which is holding the capacity n number of PC. Our application works in a way like if a student is said to perform practical on a particular PC, for a single teacher it is impossible to proctor every activity. So by installing our application on teacher’s Mobile , He/She can easily check every students activity just by selecting PC name and pressing button . The screenshot of current screen of student’s activity will be displayed in teacher’s mobile app. So in this way a Teacher can watch each student’s activity just by pressing a button sitting in office instead of monitoring  student in Lab - checking individually..!

*Real life Application*

i) This monitoring helps the authority to know about any unusual activity or any activity not supposed to be done in office/college premises, which is done by the employee.
Used in College premises in casual events like practical exam or online activities held in institutes. Using this we can watch on every individual activity of individual student 
 
ii) The same issue like with IT industry the work might  be assigned to every individual employee .Sometimes it is necessary to check whether employee is doing anything other than it, at that moment of time Manager can use our application .
